This repository is for analyzing camera trap photos that were placed on flowers. The purpose of the few functions here are to i) change the names of thousands of photos from IMG_0001:IMG_9999 to include the field site, date, and time "filenames.R" and ii) auto-generate rows in a csv file for each photo in the set such that manual analysis is easier and with fewer errors "Flower_photo_sheetMaking.R"
